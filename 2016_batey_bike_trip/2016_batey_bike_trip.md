## Day 1 - Tonasket to Oroville, 42 miles

We woke up early and drove all the way to Tonasket from Seattle. We left the
Seattle area at ~5am and arrived in Tonasket at ~10am. We mounted our bicycles
and rode from Tonasket to Oroville starting around 12pm (noon). Our route to
Oroville went through Loomis and Nighthawk Lake on our way to Osoyoos. We rode
for about 6 hours, arriving at Osoyoos Lake Veteran's Memorial Park (located in
Oroville) at around 6pm, where we stayed for the night.

## Day 2 - Oroville to Curlew, 54 miles

On this fateful day, we made a grave mistake. We wanted to get one of our bikes
looked at at a bike shop, as the gear-shifting didn't seem to be working well.
So, we decided to ride from Oroville into Osoyoos, across the Candian border,
since Osoyoos had a bicycle repair shop while Oroville did not. We departed
from our Oroville campground at ~9:45am then rode ~45 minutes/7.2 miles to get
to Osoyoos. We where there at the bike store for ~30 minutes, then rode back to
our campground, arriving at ~11:30am. This means we left for our 54 mile
journey at ~12:00pm noon. Leaving at noon was a mistake, since our route was
much tougher than we thought and took longer than we thought. Ultimately, it
took us nearly 8 hours to get to Curlew and it was getting dark by the time we
staggered in.
